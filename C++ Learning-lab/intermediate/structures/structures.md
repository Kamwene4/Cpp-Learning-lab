## Intoduction
- Structures are used to create custom data types in C++, with structures we can define custom data types called ADT(Abstract Data Types), abstraction is the general model of something.
## Declaration
## Initializing Struct
## Best Practices
- Use Pascal Case naming convention, katika programming kuna naming conventions nyingi sana ila kwenye upande wa structures tutaumia Pascal naming convention mfano; Kila neno linalo anxza linakuwa capitalized
`struct CustomerDetails`
- Whenever we create an instance of the class is the good practices to initialize it's memember 
```cpp

```
